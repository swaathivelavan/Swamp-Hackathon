Smart Safe Application - 

Allows users to send periodic location updates (SMS) to their trusted contacts and conversation recording converted into text. If a secret keyword is spoken, a call is made to higher authorities. We used Firebase Realtime database for record storage along with timestamp, AssemblyAI API for speech to text conversion, and Twilio API for communication.
